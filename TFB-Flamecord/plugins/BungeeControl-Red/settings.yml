  # Files in messages/ folder are read from top to bottom. A true value means that if you have
  # multiple messages there, we only send the first eligible message to the player (we evaluate
  # this for each player separatedly). A false value means players will see all messages
  # that are eligible for them.

  # Automatically append prefix to messages of the given type. Edit/remove/add sections below
  # from Apply_On key above to the left, and prefix to the right.
  # The message types that you do not specify below, will have no prefix unless specified
  # individually. You can also disable prefix for some messages by writing "prefix none" there.
  #
  # Example:
  # Prefix:
  #   join: "&8[&2+&8] &7"
  #   quit: "&8[&4-&8] &7"
  #   kick: "&8[&4-&8] &7"
  #   death: "&8[&4x&8] &7"

  # If you want to display join message after other plugins, you can send it
  # a bit later such as 1 tick later than the other messages.
